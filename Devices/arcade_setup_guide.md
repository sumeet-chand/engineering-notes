# UNDERSTANDING SCREEN SIZES

## CRT VS MODERN TV e.g, LCD/LED/PLASMA

Many people choose to use older CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) style TV's to use in Arcade machines to get an authentic retro gaming experience.
Thus many people option for buying and installing a CRT TV. Although fun CRT TV's are not commercially viable and what parts exist
are usually heavy, expensive, rare and difficult to repair. Regardless the emulator software's dont care what screen you use so if you 
don't want the hastle of dealing with an old CRT TV theirs nothing wrong with using a modern style Flatscreen TV. Note the build guides below
have optional schematics for CRT retro style cabinets and modern flatscreen style.

Choose whichever CRT or LCD cabinet you prefer. Note CRT cabinets are bigger as they are meant to hold
the weight of the CRT TV and in general use older Retro style cabinets, whereas Flatscreen uses more flatscreen style.

For the most authentic retro arcade cabinet results you would generally want a "4:3 aspect ratio Composite input TV". More info on
what those terms mean are below;

For reference a TV or Monitor in general refer to the same technology, though in reality each has small differences such as latency, delay, 
performance or apps, such as when watching a sport game on TV and seeing a ball get kicked on high latency/delay devices the ball will be blurred.
During this guide when talking about a TV in general it will refer to the same type of Monitor technology also. E.g, CRT TV = CRT Monitor.

## EXAMPLE CRT VS MODERN TV GAME

The following shows both the left CRT image and the right perfect pixel image
https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/owdtpu/thats_why_crt_is_unbeatable_crt_vs_pixel_perfect/

## OLED

In OLED monitors the LED to control that pixel turns off when the image is meant to display black. Thus it's a true black representation.
e.g, if you are watching a movie about space and seeing the sky, the stars will be light up by the OLED display but the blackness of space
will have the LED pixels turns off showing darkness. Thus OLED is a modern energy efficient, true display representation display technology.

## TV INPUTS

When wanting to connect a device to an CRT TV monitor to output video (or even use the TV or Monitors Speakers) you will need to connect
to the TV's inputs.

CRT TV/Monitors from the last decades of production generally supported the following input technologies

Composite (3 cables) = White (Left/Mono Audio), Red (Right Audio) and Yellow (Video)
Component (5 cables) = Red, Blue, Green (Video cables) and Green, Blue (Audio cables)
Scart = Big connector

In general most 20th centure retro game consoles use composite cables. As long as you connect your device with an adapter or propriety
cable to a CRT TV's with Yellow cable you can view video output. If you're device such as your using for game emulation has it's own USB/3.5mm
headphone jack you can output the audio to that instead of the White and Red Mono/Stero audio output on the TV.

Mono Audio refers to sound coming out of all a TV's speakers in one direction, whereas Stero audio refers to Audio coming out from either Left
or Right (or more if you have a surround sound speaker setup such as in a Movie Theatre) directions. This is more immersive but not strictly 
necessary as retro games don't usually have stero audio and it wont cause gameplay issues playing only mono audio.

## ASPECT RATION & RESOLUTIONS

Aspect ratio & resolution refer to the field in which you view something. A 1:1 aspect ratio means a square field, whereas a 16:9 field
is a rectangular viewing field. On larger and wider Monitors that handle higher aspect ratios such as 16:9 with higher resolutions 1920 x 1080p 
you can view lower aspect ratio and resolution content within it causing black bars to appear in the unused spaces.

Resolutions are a number representation of a viewing angles pixels width and height which maintain the specified aspect ratio 
by keeping the width and height proportional. Thus a aspect ratio of 1:1 square has a pixel width and height equal as it's a square
e.g, 5000 w by 5000 h or 500 w by 500h thus the aspect ratio of 4:3 supports any resolutions that are squares.

For example a Widescreen Modern (16:9) with 1920x1080 resolution playing a game in 4:3 800x600 resolution. The sides are unused.

+------------+--------------+------------+ 
| +-----------+------------+-----------+ |
| |           |            |           | |
| |           |   Hello    |           | |
| |           |   World    |           | |
| |           |            |           | |
| +-----------+------------+-----------+ |
+------------+--------------+------------+
                   | |
                   | |
                 __+_+__


Why this is important is because many old games were developed in the CRT TV era with 4:3 aspect ratio and squarish resolutions.
Playing any game developed in resolutions for 4:3 ratios in a bigger aspect ratio/resolution monitor causes the images to 
be stretched out. If you are emulating a game in a modern monitor with a high resolution this isn't an issue as it will add black bars on 
the side to compensate.

However when building an retro inspired arcade machine cabinet and wanting an authentic look you will usually be limited to using 4:3 monitors.
Often as this cannot be found you will find many companies subsitute with 5:4 more common newer models (such as Arcade1up reproductions)
however this can cause the game to be stretched. Note some arcade games prefer different orientations also such as Pacman/Galaga/Early arcade
titles being vertical 19" monitors.

This wont cause gameplay issues if using emulator software but is something to keep in mind. If building a retro style arcade machine 
use a 4:3 CRT TV monitor, and if building a modern style, pick the highest resolution as the emulation software will compensate by 
creating bars, or artwork to hide the unused portions of the viewing display while playing a game.

## DEGAUSSING CRT

Many TV's have inbuilt degaussers within them either from a setting option, or from turning on or off. For many extremely older style
CRT devices you will have to degauss which means fix the imperfections of the display when the TV is turned off such as odd colouring.

## DEAD VS STUCK PIXEL

On CRT monitors pixels often become stuck.

A Stuck pixel is a always on red, green, blue or white pixel that doesn't change when viewing different content. Restarting often or 
seeing if your TV/Monitor has inbuilt menu options for restarting can fix this issue.

On LED monitors a pixel can be stuck or dead.

A dead pixel appears as a black dot. The actual pixel is dead. Dead pixels cannot be repaired in most circumstances but can go away on
their own which can take any indefinite time e.f, from a few weeks to a lifetime.

# BUILDING ARCADE MACHINES

Why collect, mod, or build arcade machines/cabinets? because they are fun and you learn lots of skills.

These steps outline how to build your own custom arcade machine from scratch either yourself or with a carpenters help
to cut the wood (machine) the parts so you can put together, as well as various ways to paint the cab. Once the cab is built
and all electronics added you can skip to the Retropie Setup steps to finally add retro game emulation on it

Benefits of building your own machine include being able to have 1 of each game type (e.g. Fighting, seated racing, or gun arcade cabinet)
that you can customise however you want.

If you feel this is too much effort you can always buy Arcade1UP arcade machines and use the below modding guide to customise.

NOTE: 
* Arcade joystick cables are called "2.8mm Terminal Quick Connects" arcade cables.
* Arcade button holes are 28mm diameter, as well as the buttons diameters, and for grommets etc.,

There are schematics here for many original authentic cabinets you can use to build your own here: https://www.classicarcadecabinets.com/

The steps below can be used to build any generic arcade cabinet but I've included schematics for a CRT, Flatscreen and racing simulation/cockpit
cabinet that you are free to print out, cut and use for simplicity sake. When you see steps for CRT/for Flatscreen mentioned
they are referring to the default designs below;

Remember either option you choose you can swivel the TV to face any angle or orientation you want. With CRT It's a matter of adding
wooden base in cabinet and with flatscreen you can swivel the VEGA bracket. Regardless if you choose a custom orientation it's
best to pair with a black cardboard/wood cutout and/or acrylic glass to match.

EXAMPLE BELOW

175cm, 27" flatscreen panel, PACMAN custom cabinet painted 1: sun yellow gloss, 2: black gloss, with diamond kickplate, and the coin buttons
replaced with 33mm wide (28mm internal diameter) grommet to cut and feed controller cables through also for charging phones.

## WOOD CHOICE

For anywhere remotely outdoor usage or with extreme tempratures, then "Marine Plywood" is the most water, humidity, rotting, cracking and warping resistant material.
It's made of many layers of waterproof glued together, and due to being made by humans is free from void when glueing and each board is wrapped
opposite grain the former so it's interlocked and strenghtened.

Timber is strong and heavy and costs more, but is quality material.

MDF is the cheapest and has it's use cases but is prone to weather damage.

## WOOD CUTTING SERVICES LOCATIONS

For Marrickville, Sydney, Australia see: https://lasercuts.com.au/laser-cutting/

## METHEDOLOGY

1. Cut 18mm wood with t-moulding (t-moulding will overhang on 16mm size cabinets) using schematics below.
Note: control panel top does need to be sanded once placed.
Note: For cutting control panel inputs for coin you can just skip and route cable to coin door, or cut holes on top of control panel alongside
player 1 and 2 buttons.
* For CRT cabinets: __________________________________________________________
schematics and images are in archive```/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx```
FEATURES:
     * _____________________________________
     * _____________________________________
* For Flatscreen cabinets schematics and images are in archive ```/27inch-flatscreen-arcade-machine-plans.rar``` copyright belongs to RetroArcadeSolutions. Not for distribution. Internal demonstration use only.
FEATURES:
     * 170cm tall
     * Supports Flatscreen tv up to 27"
3. Print vinyl
Common vinyl wraps and artwork for arcades are below
PACMAN: https://arcarc.xmission.com/Web%20Archives/Pac%20Man/Pacman%20Graphics/PACANAC.htm
4. Paint cabinet
Common paint codes are below
PACMAN: Buy any "sun yellow" color glossy spray paint
5. Purchase adapters
For CRT cabinets: you will need to purchasea "HDMI to RCA Converter" or "HDMI to Scart" (If your TV supports the superior display quality SCART input on certain old CRT TV models) to plug into Raspberry Pi/PC.
6. Purchase light guns - buy "Sinden Light gun with recoil 2 packs" which work on any screen https://www.sindenshop.com/
7. 3D print the Sinden Lightgun holsters x 2 without the logo version from here https://www.printables.com/model/228065-sinden-lightgun-holster-for-arcade
8. Add screw on small standard rubber wheels to base for easy transport/moving arcade
9. Adjust CRT TV/Flatscreen orientation/angle to your liking
10. Optional - Add diamond tread kickplate to front, and possibly sides (this is the metal plate to prevent kicking damage to wood)
11. Add Marquee - print/cut out a marquee for your cabinet e.g, "Joust" then add LED wardrobe lights
12. Add t-moulding
13. Add joystick and buttons to encoder
14. Optional Add double coin door with mechanism with lights. 
* To add coindoor lights buy a "arcade wedge bulb" with a voltage e.g, 5v, 6v or 12v which matches the encoder boards voltage output and buy a matching socket "wedge globe socket" https://www.retroblast.com/articles/coindoor.html 

Remember that over the years various coin door and game manufacturers used two different voltages and two different bases of lamps (actually 3 if you count Centipede cocktail's screw base lamps).
A 6 volt lamp can be run from 5 volts perfectly fine, but never run them from any higher voltage than 6 volts!

WEDGE BASE
159 is 6 volts
259 is 6 volts
555 is 6 volts
194 is 12 volts
161 is 12 volts
658 is 12 volts

BAYONET BASE
44 is 6 volts
47 is 6 volts
1847 is 6 volts
1813 is 12 volts
756 is 12 volts

So you will need a e.g, 555 bulb, arcade bulb holder, and a acade button microswitch to connect it together and fit physically onto the coin door and encoder
* How to adjust the coin mechanism to accept your desired regions coins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09J4fO1yC8w 
* How to connect connecting to encoder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFRnm6Et1zc
You will need to purchase a 30mm lock for the arcade which are often purchased alongside or just google search "30mm arcade coin door lock" and buy (with the key of course)
if adding a coin door, then you may want to add a "cable grommet" in place of an existing "coin" button, so you can use for an controller cable to play console
games e.g, Megadrive/Genesis controller.
15. Buy 5.25" car speakers (4" is sufficient for smaller cabinets, but 5.25") and any channel amplifier e.g. 
Amplifier: Kinter MA170 12V 2 Channel Mini Digital Audio Power Amplifier for Car or Mp3
Speakers: BOSS Audio Systems BRS52 Car Speakers - 60 Watts of Power, 5.25 Inch, Full Range,
Cut some speaker wire to size and crimp ends with "quick connect/spade terminal ends" and for each speaker put the positive into posiive of left side and negative into negative of left side, and repeat
for the second speaker for the right side, now you have stereo audio. Connect a 3.5mm headphone male to male from the amplifier to the computer's headphone jack. 
16. Add TV
17. Cutout TV screen size from black thick paper/cardboard cutout to cover TV sides
18. Cut acrylic glass to match black cutout size to cover TV
19. Setup the computer with emulator following EMULATOR SETUP

### BUILDING SEATED RACING CABINET

1. Simplest option is to buy a "full motion racing cockpit simulator" by searching on Google e.g, https://dofreality.com/
2-axis is the cheapest and 6-axis full motion is the most expensive. Consider buying universal controls for Racing & Flying 
e.g, https://dofreality.com/product/universal/universal-motion-platform-6-axis-hero-h6/
2. Then add your TV, console/PC, connect it together using the EMULATOR SETUP
3. Get wood cut and ordered using the schematics here ____________________ and assemble
4. Print and place vinyl wrap

# MODIFYING ARCADE1UP MACHINES

If you have an existing Arcade1up cabinet the following steps outline the ways to improve the cosmetic and functional aspects of it.
Once the cab is built and all electronics added you can skip to the Retropie Setup steps to finally add retro game emulation on it

1. BUILD CUSTOM RISER

If the height of the Arcade1UP cabinets are too short you can increase with custom risers. The steps below outline different size comparisons
and different options depending on the generation/model of cabinets you have.

Size comparisons located in this file: /Arcade/Arcade1up-size-comparisons.jpg

3/4 cabs: varies (h)
Deluxe cab: 155cm (h)
XL cab: 165cm (h) + 3" wider

Both 3/4 and Deluxe cabinets share same length and width dimensions and fit same riser
https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/167qcsp/can_the_deluxe_cabinets_be_put_on_risers/ 
XL cabs are also authentic but they are huge. Deluxe provide the middle ground authentic footprint arcade experience.

FOR DELUXE CABINETS

OPTION A - Flush riser

Buy a flush riser then put metal diamond tread kickplates on all sides to prevent wear and tear
Cons are it will cause balance instability and exhuberate the rocking issue with these top heavy tall cabs (serious consideration)

2. ADD DIAMOND TREAD KICKPLATE
To protect the bottom of the arcade cabinet from being damaged from repeated kicks such as in commercial settings you can
tape or glue a metal sheet at the front following this example guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf4RVx3Bs-o

3. HACK SOFTWARE TO ADD EMULATORS | ANY GAME
Arcade1up new cab models that have a MicroSD card slot have an Android Operating System.
The OS cab be customised so that you can install any application manually from SD Card (Not
from the Google Play Store as Google hasn't authorised any cab models to allow this functionality).
follow this guide to learn more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gkwDe9c7w

4. LIGHT UP COIN DOOR
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsZ99HHl2U0

5. ADD REAL COIN DOOR
First purchase an "2.8mm Terminal Quick Connects split arcade cables" then follow this guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSyySSv1ywQ

6. ADD CUSTOM LIT MARQUEE

7. FIX LOW LEVEL SPEAKER STATIC
The static can be fixed, I bought a better quality 12v power supply off Amazon and a TRRS Male to Female Stereo Audio Jack Extender 
Aux Extension Adapter Cords with Volume Control. Its a pain that they have the gain too high off the PCB and a noisy power supply, 
this way I can turn the gain down manually and it lowers the noise floor. The other fix is the reroute the headphone jack which is 
line level out and connect the speakers to that but I wanted to be able to still use headphones. It is kinda weird / lazy that they
have not fixed an annoying problem that has a relatively cheap fix. - Youtube commenter @user-pi6cs3ue4s 
August 2024 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alf4X3mJsHQ

8. ADD LINK CABLE FOR MULTIPLAYER
https://www.buystuffarcades.com/products/ridge-racer-and-outrun-mod-kit

9. REPLACE JOYSTICK BUTTONS
You can choose to replace the stock cheap Arcade1up buttons on the non XL models with better products. You will need to buy
Sanwa style arcade buttons
1. Follow this to replace buttons - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09DQCOr6zQM

10. ADD BIGGER SCREEN
To add a different size monitor or TV to an existing Arcade1up cabinet such as increasing the screen size for shooter games
you need the below;
1 x Geekworm HDMI to LDVS 20 (a.k.a 2.0) adapter - https://geekworm.com/products/lvds-to-hdmi-adapter-board-converter-with-lvds-cable
1 x HDMI cable
1 x TV/Monitor
1 x VEGA bracket support frame
STEPS
a. Disconnect the Arcade1up PCB board from the stock monitor and connect to LDVS conveter in Channel 1
ensure the twisted ribbon style cable you connect has the dot on it's plastic seated in the same PCB dot reference (PIN 1)
Optionally, Seperate the board from the LCD with cardboard and double sided tape to prevent electrial shorting
b. add HDMI cable to LDVS and TV and turn on game and test. If flickering/drop outs occour then test with Channel 2 position
d. Once desired position is kept add the Wood/VEGA frame to Arcade cabinet and TV and connect all back together and test

# RETROARCH INSTALL STEPS

If you want an graphical software that has emulators that represent various game consoles to play games on such as Atari, or Sega, then
you need to generally install a software like "Retroarch". Retroarch is a multi emulator front and backend software which can be installed 
on many operating systems such as windows, mac or various linux distributions or even as a Steam game app and allows you to download various 
consoles such as Sega Megadrive within it. 

Once installed point to a file location containing various games known as roms, 
setup key bindings, set to download game artwork and launch Retroarch and get started choosing a retro or modern game console and game to play. 
The guide below advises how to setup Retroarch on Windows, Mac and Linux distro's and get BIOS for game consoles.

Note that when installing Retroarch through Retropie it automatically installs an frontend GUI software called "Emulation Station".

Note some users may choose to install an additional frontend ontop of the basic graphical interface of Retroarch. Once such example is
Launchbox which is discussed in the following section. 

## BIOS

What is a BIOS and why is it needed?

BIOS represent the Operating System of a console. Old retro consoles like gameboys don't have an OS like modern consoles
such as Playstation, therefore retro console emulators can run games without a need for a BIOS.

To obtain a bios requires dumping (extracting) the files from your existing console. Considering you own the consoles
already you can conveniently find a list of all BIOS needed for Retroarch here: https://github.com/Abdess/retroarch_system
download the files and put them in the default /retroarch/system/ folder 
e.g. on Windows If you want to play Playstation games on Retroarch then dump from your own console or for ease download the bios folder from above link 
for Playstation then add the files below
C:\RetroArch-Win64\system\scph5500.bin
C:\RetroArch-Win64\system\scph5501.bin
C:\RetroArch-Win64\system\scph5502.bin

## CORES

Cores are the individual emulator softwares that are downloaded and installed within Retroarch. So instead of managing multiple software
to emulate different consoles you can add them all to a single software like Retroarch.

For Arcade games MAME is the arcade emulator. MAME versions are backwards compatible so it's always recommended to have the latest up 
to date installed (or downloaded as a core as part of Retroarch). In Retroarch download core "Arcade (MAME)" this always refers to the 
latest version of MAME which works with the latest ROM verions.

You can install MAME standalone as a software on an PC without Retroarch, or in Retroarch add the latest version of the installed
MAME on the PC as a core to then play the latest versions of the games.

For all consoles that you will want on Retroarch, you will need to download the Cores for e.g, if you want to play Playstation 1 games
on your arcade machine then in Retroarch download "Sony Playstation (beetle)" then add the BIOS "See section BIOS" and add games to ROM folder
and import the content/scan the games, set the default core and start a game.

## ROMS

We do not condone piracy of games. If you require games (roms) then you will need legally own and dump the games or search online
for them if you already own them.

### PAL OR NTSC/JAP | REGION DIFFERENCES

ROM is read only memory. Cartridge based consoles such as old Sega Megadrives, or Gameboys used physical game cartridges which contained memory modules that held all the game code 
and when dumped meaning copied digitially from the catridge such as to a computer the resulting file is referred to as a ROM.

CD based consoles use disc images that have been ripped from the CD and can be in many formats such as .bin/.cue, .img, .chd, .rvz, .zso and many others. They are the same thing
conceptually as a ROM when it comes to a digital copy of a physical game.

Their are 2 major types of retro ROMS to download PAL vs NTSC/JAP. Most retro classic games were made in Japan or North America and thus
were created to run at a 60hz TV refresh rate, contrasted to PAL regions which are everywhere else e.g, Europe, Australia, South America
the TV's run at 50hz.

What this means is when you play a NTSC/JAP game it runs at the intended full speed of 60 Frames per second which their TV's can handle.
But old PAL CRT TV's and Consoles are often too slow to run at the 60FPS (Frames per second) and thus are reduced to 50 FPS. So playing
a PAL game is often slower if it's not a modern optimised version.

Their is also an incompatability between running the opposite region game on a region locked console e.g, playing Sonic 1 (NTSC)
on a Australian PAL Megadrive will have issues playing.

Thus the correct ROM version to buy/download/play is subjective It really depends on the console/TV refresh rate/game regional differences.

EXAMPLE 1: PAL Megadrive console is locked to playing any game at 50hz regardless of cartrdige/rom used in it.
EXAMPLE 2: Gameboy era games run at 60hz and not frame locked so you can get any version of the game you prefer.

So really it depends on your console, if your using emulator, what TV refresh rate your using and the game itself, and if theirs region locking on the game
and finally games themselves have translation/localisation differences such as cencorship or removing/adding content.

In general when using an emulator it's best to use NTSC/JAP Roms for all games, but when using retro hardware it's a case by case basis depending on your Console/TV/Cartrdige hardware setup.

If your unsure still you can always dump both versions of the ROM as long as you own them, or you can seperate into 2 different folders so that way 
it's easier to manage e.g, folder 1: megadrive (PAL), and folder 2: megadrive (NTSC JAP)


## BITS

In the past (pre year 2000) game consoles were judged on bits.

Bit refers to the size of data used in input and output (like pipes) of a computers brain (called the CPU) and it's related hardware. They are used for game logic, 
drawing images/sprites and colours and controller inputs. Thus the more bits the more things can happen in a game and more complex games you can make.

In the past we really only had the CPU doing all the hard work.

Now it doesn't matter because we have specialised chips to do certain tasks e.g. GPU = Graphic Card for drawing graphics on a screen. NPU = chip for Artificial 
Intelligence/Machine Learning tasks like what chess move to perform, and of course the good old CPU which is the brain of everything has less work these days.

## WINDOWS INSTALL STEPS

Install Retroarch from here: https://www.retroarch.com/

## MAC INSTALL STEPS

Install Retroarch from here: https://www.retroarch.com/

## LINUX INSTALL STEPS

Setting up Retroarch on Linux is often difficult and time consuming, you can choose to setup yourself using below link
Install Retroarch from here: https://www.retroarch.com/ 
or use Retropie which runs on may Linux distro's (not just Raspberry Pi) which runs a bunch of scripts that installs and configures; 
1. User account "pi" with all necessary permissions
2. Default drivers (if RaspberryPi)
3. Retroarch
4. All emulator cores (even for PS1 games to work without BIOS if not yet added)
5. All ROM folders, etc.,
6. Emulation Station (from git pull ./make not from apt)
7. Autoboot to "emulationstation" launcher

So you can see it does quite alot. If you want a dedicated linux emulator device
then best use RetroPie to automatically do it all.

## RETROPIE SETUP STEPS

1. INSTALLING FROM IMAGE
```bash
1. Use PI imager - Select Raspberry Pi OS - Select storage medium e.g, Micro SD Card - Enable SSH during setup - Enable Wifi and add login details - 
Install - Plug Micro SD card into Pi then done. 
2. Find the IP address of the Raspberry PI e.g. either from router or arp -a command if on same network 
```

2. OPTIONAL. CHANGING WIFI PASSWORD IF FORGOT TO ADD TO IMAGE ABOVE
```bash
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf # edit this file

network={
    ssid="YourNetworkName" # update this with your wifis name
    psk="YourPassword" # add your wifis password here
}
```

3. ACCESS PI VIA SSH
```bash
ssh pi@IP_GOES_HERE
password %: raspberry
```

4. UPDATE PI
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

5. OPTIONAL - FOR PI 5 BOOT FROM NVME M.2
```bash
a. Connect a compatible m.2 hat for the Pi 5 and add connect NVME m.2 storage media and to the pi
b. In Raspberry Pi imager "you can reopen it if you closed it" click Storage then select the NVME m.2 storage media
follow instructions
c. sudo raspi-config
d. Advanced Options
e. Boot Order
f. NVME/USB Boot
g. sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
h. insert line below
dtparam=pciex1_gen3
i. sudo reboot now
```

6. INSTALL RETROPI
```bash
# 1. Run code below
cd ~
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup.git
cd RetroPie-Setup
sudo ./retropie_setup.sh

# 2. At the installation screen select - basic installation - yes/continue
# 3. Installation will continue. For an estimation it took ~60 minutes on a Raspberry Pi 5 with at least 20MBps Wifi, so older models will take  much longer
# 4. Reboot device with command ```sudo reboot now```
```

7. OPTIONAL - INSTALL FTP AND OPEN PORT 21 FOR FILE TRANSFER (ONLY IF NOT SETUP DURING BOOT IMAGE ADDITIONAL STEPS)
```bash
sudo apt install vsftpd
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
Uncomment local_enable=YES # to allow local users to log in.
Uncomment write_enable=YES # to allow write access to the FTP server.
netstat -tuln # check if port now open
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd # then restart service and view port 21 now available for FTP
pi@retropi:~ $ tcp6       0      0 :::21                   :::*                    LISTEN 
```

8. OPTIONAL CHANGE ROMS FOLDER AND MOUNT USB
```bash
# 1. When a storage drive is connected to a linux computer, it will either appear under. If the below entries are empty the device needs to be mounted first.
ls /mnt
ls /media

# 2. Run code below to find mounts
pi@retropie:~ $ lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda           8:0    1 233.1G  0 disk
└─sda1        8:1    1 233.1G  0 part
mmcblk0     179:0    0  29.2G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   512M  0 part /boot/firmware
└─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0  28.7G  0 part /

# 3. We can see under ```/sda/sda1``` there is the unmounted USB storage. To mount first create a directory for it, then mount the unmounted drive to it
sudo mkdir /mnt/romusb
pi@retropie:~ $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/romusb
pi@retropie:~ $ ls /mnt/romusb
 ROMS  'System Volume Information'

# 4. To make a mount persistent across reboots first find the storage media id
pi@retropie:~ $ sudo blkid
/dev/mmcblk0p1: LABEL_FATBOOT="bootfs" LABEL="bootfs" UUID="91FE-7499" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTUUID="4c3c1c9b-01"
/dev/mmcblk0p2: LABEL="rootfs" UUID="56f80fa2-e005-4cca-86e6-19da1069914d" BLOCK_SIZE="4096" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="4c3c1c9b-02"
/dev/sda1: LABEL="SanDisk" UUID="2C5B-D063" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="exfat" PARTUUID="c3072e18-01"
D18B-7F52
# 5. Edit the fstab file to input the UUID of the storage edia
pi@retropie:~ $ sudo nano /etc/fstab

proc            /proc           proc    defaults          0       0
PARTUUID=4c3c1c9b-01  /boot/firmware  vfat    defaults          0       2
PARTUUID=4c3c1c9b-02  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
# a swapfile is not a swap partition, no line here
#   use  dphys-swapfile swap[on|off]  for that
UUID=2C5B-D063 /mnt/romusb exfat defaults,nofail 0 0 # <- here is where we put the UUID of the SanDisk storage media above

# 6. Run below code to change the default emulationstation rom search path for each core to the new mounted path in this file ```/etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg```
sudo sed -i 's|<path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/|<path>/mnt/romusb/ROMS/|g' /etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg

# 7. verification below
pi@retropie:~ $ sudo nano /etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<systemList>
  <system>
    <name>amstradcpc</name>
    <fullname>Amstrad CPC</fullname>

    <platform>amstradcpc</platform>
    <theme>amstradcpc</theme>
  </system>
```

9. OPTIONAL IF USING SDCARD AS ROM STORAGE - TRANSFER GAMES FROM STORAGE MEDIA (e.g, USB) TO MICROSD
IMPORTANT: PS2 games come in single .iso (DVD games) or a older 2 files together .bin/.cue (CD-ROM) style
a. Find the "Rom Folder" names for each emulator you want e.g. for Gameboy
the emulator Rom Folder name is "gb" from official docs - https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Game-Boy/ 
b. Make the folders on a USB and fill them with roms that you dumped from your own cartridges
c. Plug the USB into any USB slot of the raspberry pi and first see which usb folder it's in
e.g. /media/usb or usb1 - 4
d. Copy all the folders over. You can also use FileZilla or any FTP software to do the same thing with a GUI interface easily
```bash
cp -r /media/usb1/* /home/pi/RetroPie/roms 
```

10. ADD BIOS
(Necessary for PS1 and all CD based modern retro consoles)
a. Find the BIOS somewhere e.g. by dumping your own consoles BIOS
or here if you legally own the console: https://github.com/Abdess/retroarch_system/releases/
b. Put all files (e.g. for PS1) in ```/home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS``` either with command below or using a simple GUI software like Filezilla
```bash
cp scph5500.bin, scph5501.bin, scph5502.bin /home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS
```

11. SETUP - START EMULATION STATION (THE FRONTEND SOFTWARE) OR START GAME ON BOOT
```bash
# 1. add code below

nano /opt/retropie/configs/all/autostart.sh
# To start any rom on startup type/replace the core and rom path with the game 
/opt/retropie/supplementary/runcommand/runcommand.sh 0 _SYS_ mame-libretro ~/RetroPie/roms/mame-libretro/sf2ce.zip &&$
# emulationstation #auto


# 2. To reverse the above change comment the top and uncomment the bottom.

pi@retropie:~ $ cat /opt/retropie/configs/all/autostart.sh
# /opt/retropie/supplementary/runcommand/runcommand.sh 0 _SYS_ mame-libretro ~/RetroPie/roms/mame-libretro/sf2ce.zip && emulationstation
emulationstation #auto
pi@retropie:~ $
```

12. INSTALL CORES MANUALLY | MISSING ROMS
```bash
# 1. Follow previous step to mount ROMS USB or migrate the ROMS to the MicroSD card's /home/pi/retropi/roms folder
# 2. From emulation station select Retropi settings -> retropie settings -> manage packages -> install all installed core packages -> then restart emulation system
# 3. Now the games will appear, don't forget to scrap the artwork
```

# MAME RETROARCH SETUP

1. See section RETROARCH INSTALL STEPS to install Retroarch to manage MAME (Easiest method)
2. In Retroarch install core : Arcade (MAME)
This is always the latest up to date verion of MAME
3. Dump all the ROMS, conveniently you can download from here: https://r-roms.github.io/megathread/retro/
In this scenario we will be using ROM set 0.265 so follow link above to here
https://archive.org/details/mame-merged
and download the following into the same ROM folder as all other Retroarch games are pointing to; or make a new folder to store these games if not using retroarch
4. MAME BIOS Sets: https://archive.org/download/mame-merged/BIOS/

# RETROARCH CONFIGURATION

NOTE: If using Retropie to access Retroarch settings In main menu (core/emulator section) select RetroPie - RetroArch (will open a new menu)

### RESOLUTION CHANGE
```bash
# If os doesn't fit inside the window e.g. a Retropi in an arcade cabinet
# has the bottom screen e.g. the text CLI prompt part cut off, then
# adjust the padding/overlay
# NOTE: it may be moved to /boot/firmware/config.txt
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
# uncomment the below and the higher the number the more it moves in so
overscan_left=5 # padding 5 from left
overscan_bottom=5 # padding from the bottom
# if using nano
# CTRL - X
# Y
# PRESS ENTER
# done. If error, then close file and run with sudo
sudo reboot now # then view screen, test and adjust accordingly
```

### RUMBLE FEATURE

such as an official Playstation 4 controller then when in a quick menu for a game click on controls - port 1 controls - device type - set to Dualshock

### SWAP DPAD FOR ANALOG STICK FOR OLDER GAMES

For older games you can force the analogue stick to work as the dpad. when in a quick menu for a game click on controls - port 1 controls - analog to digital type - left analog (forced). Now you can enjoy old d-pad only games such as gameboy games using an left analog stick.

### ADD GAMES
Settings - Import contents - select the individual folders which have your game roms then click scan directory.
Games will then automatically be added to Playlists

### ADD UNLICENSED AFTERMARKET ROMS
Some third party games e.g, itch.io gamejam/fan-made gameboy games will not add to playlists due to not being in the Retroarchs game CRC checksum 
database. To get around this perform the below;
Import content - Manual scan - Content Directory (Select the folder containing the third party roms) - System Name & Default Core 
(select the default core to use [e.g, Gambatte for Gameboy]) - select Start scan. Now third part games will appear in appropriate playlist

### DELETING GAMES | REMOVE ENTRY FROM PLAYLIST
You can delete a game by deleting the file from the text terminal when you SSH into the device if Ubuntu, or from going to the game
in retroarch and in menu clicking remove game. However it may still appear in your playlist. To fix perform below;
Settings - Playlist - Manage Playlist - select the playlist - cleanup playlist

```

### GAMEBOY GAMES CHANGE COLOUR PALETTE

Old gameboy games may not have color codes in which case start game - go to core options - set GB colorization to "GBC"
otherwise it will default if left on "Auto" to the "Internal Palette" which is the default "GB - DMG" green screen.

For any other game the "Auto" option will automatically select the best palette.

Recap - for green gameboy old games - set GB Coloirzation to "GBC"

### LOADING MULTIPLE DISCS | MULTI DISC GAMES | CHANGE DISC

If the ROM/game has multiple Disc's such as playstation 1 games then do the following.
From experience it's best to do this step before playing the game and creating a save file as it may not be found (citation needed.)
1. Create a file with the ROM/games name and save with the file extension .m3u  e.g, "Cool Game.m3u" within the same folder as all other ROM files
2. Edit the file and add the discs (.cue) files of the game e.g,
"
Cool Game (Europe) (Disc 1).cue
Cool Game (Europe) (Disc 2).cue
"
3. Start Retroarch - Import content - select the ROM folder (which also has he .m3u file) - and you will see only 1 game to select from in the Playlist. You can now play the game.
4. In game when advised to change discs - go to quick menu - Disc Control - Eject Disc - select the new disc from the Index by scrolling left/right to change to next index number e.g, from "1" to "2"
then click "Insert disc" - then go back to game

Note if you add games this way then you must always use "Manual Scan" option to combine all CD's into 1 game in Retroarch.

### MULTIPLAYER GAMES

For example to host and join a game of Joust on MAME using RetroArch, follow these steps:

Ensure port 55435 is not blocked through firewall for host or client

HOST SETUP GAME STEPS

1. Both you and your friend need to have the same version of RetroArch installed.
2. Ensure that both players have the same ROM file for Joust and are using the same MAME core (e.g., MAME 2003, MAME 2010, etc.).
3. Both players should also have the same version of the MAME core loaded in RetroArch.
4. The host player (e.g., in New Zealand) should ensure that their router has port forwarding enabled for RetroArch's default port (55435) to their local machine.
This can be done by accessing your router's settings and adding a port forwarding rule that forwards traffic on port 55435 to your internal IP address (the IP of the machine running RetroArch).
5. The host player should note down their public IP address (e.g., 110.10.10.10). You can find this by searching "what is my IP" in a search engine.
6. Open RetroArch and load the MAME core.
8. Load the Joust ROM using the MAME core.
9. Go to the Quick Menu "START + SELECT" - "Netplay" - "Start Netplay Host"
You will now be hosting the game on your public IP and the default port (55435)

CLIENT JOIN GAME STEPS

1. Open RetroArch and load the MAME core.
2. Load the Joust ROM using the MAME core.
3. Go to the Quick Menu "START + SELECT" - "Netplay" - "Connect to Netplay Host"
4. Enter the public IP address of the host (110.10.10.10) and the port (55435).
5. Retroarch will attempt to join the game

### SWAP D PAD MOVEMENT FOR LEFT ANALOG STICK

For some games e.g, Playstation 1, which only use d-pad for movement such as Xenogears, you can go into the quick settings "START + SELECT"
- Controls - Port 1 Controls - Analog to Digital type - set to Left Analog. Now you can control movement with the stick.s

### AI LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS

You can use the power of AI to translate foreign while playing a game using an running AI on your computer
and with the Retroarch Hotkey for AI services pressed. See more here: https://docs.libretro.com/guides/ai-service/

### BLUETOOTH CONNECT CONTROLLER
There are 2 options for setting up a controller depending if you have an existing working keyboard or not

2a. NO ATTACHED KEYBOARDS
```bash
a. Get the IP of the device with: ifconfig
b. PuTTy into device: pi@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (using IP from above)
c. Run command: sudo ~/RetroPie-Setup/retropie_setup.sh 
```
2b. WITH KEYBOARD ATTACHED & AT RETROPI  INTERFACE
a. From emulation station select Retropi settings -> retropie settings

3. Click -> bluetooth -> remove devices - then remove device if it already exists and go back

4. Put the controller into pairing mode e.g, for Dualsense press both the Create (Select) button + PS Logo button and hold until light blinks (pairing mode)

5. Click search for bluetooth devices - while the controller is in pairing mode - select your wireless controller

6. Go back to main emulation station menu -> start/menu -> configure input -> setup buttons for new controller

 
### ADD SCREEN SAVERS
1. From emulation station -> start -> UI settings -> screensaver settings -> screen saver behaviour -> either set to "Random video" OR "slideshow"
2. From emulation station -> retropie settings -> splashscreens -> download (this will download videos for your ROMS to your SD card so ensure it's at least > 128GBs)
Slideshow will automatically loop through game art that's scrapped through so follow steps to scrap all images.
3. You can test with "Select" button to bring up screensavers, and you can start any game displayed by pressing start

# LAUNCHBOX FRONTEND SETUP

As discussed earlier within retroarch section, it's optional to install a frontend graphical user software
on top of retroarch. (Note Retropie already installs "Emulation Station" as a frontend GUI software for simplicity. You can choose to replace if you desire).

Launchbox is an innovative frontend GUI because it allows using a second monitor (e.g, a physical marquee LCD screen above your primary display)
as a digital marquee. E.g, https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcade1Up/comments/o2nvtg/my_modded_a1us_final_form_lcd_dynamic_marquee/

If you like the design you can follow the steps below to install it over Retroarch.
