# TERMINOLOGIES


# RESOURCES

To find out how to Rever Engineer, you will need a software to first decompile an executable e.g, Ghidra developed by NSA/CIA.

# LEARNING

## FOR BEGINNERS

To learn Reverse Engineering the easiest way to get started is with simple zipped files you can attempt to hack, by having a program
such as Ghidra attempt to decompile the program from Assembly to C, and within the C code try to find the code to the Zip files. 
One such Website is https://crackmes.one
This site is dedicated to reverse engineering challenges, known as "crackmes." Users upload binaries or ZIP files, and others attempt to crack them.

## FOR ADVANCED USERS



## FOR EXPERTS

The skies the limit, go ahead and start reverse engineering any software, games, enterprise software, web browsers, operating systems. Go wild!
